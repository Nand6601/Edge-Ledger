# Project 2: EdgeLedger-Website

[Click here](https://competent-montalcini-1ff6c9.netlify.app/) for the live demo  of the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> This is a website for a Financial Service firm, that informs about the company, their business case studies, blog posts written by the experts of the company, their higher management, and a working callback request form to reach out to them.

- The navbar is made transparent and opaque depending on the scroll condition, a bouncing effect is added. `Smooth scrolling` is achieved. These are done using `JavaScript`.

- An `image overlay` is created for the hero image using `::before and ::after pseudo-selectors`.

- Icons are used from `Font Awesome`.

- `Flexbox` is used for creating layouts.

- Images are zoomed-in with the corresponding descriptions, and navigation buttons using `lightbox-2`.

- Separate blogpost pages are created.

- A request callback form is created with form validation that is created using `Netlify Forms` for data collection.

- A `favicon` is added with a .ico format.

- The website is made `responsive` to all the devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

- CSS is precompiled using `SCSS` for the structured coding.

- The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

- The project is a part of the learning from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s course on Udemy. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
